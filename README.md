University Management System

A C++ project that simulates a University Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project manages students, faculty, courses, and departments in a simple, console-based system.

Features

Implemented using OOP principles: classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

Dynamic memory management for flexible storage of data.

Built using CMake for easy compilation and organization.

Modular and easy to extend for future enhancements.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:UsmanRiaz257/UniversityManagementSystem.git


Build the project with CMake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


Run the program:

./UniversityManagementSystem

Usage

Add, update, and view students, faculty, and courses.

Designed as a console-based application for learning and demonstration purposes.

Can be extended with file handling, database integration, or a GUI in the future.

Notes

This project is mainly for learning OOP, dynamic memory, and basic CMake usage.

Avoid committing the build/ folder; it’s generated during compilation.
